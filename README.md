# AirlineCalculator
A script that allows the user to calculate the shortest path between flights using the adjacency list data structure and Dijkstra's Algorithm.
/* I am unable to provide the code at this time as it would break the Integrity Pledge of my school for sharing work, and could possibly provide a way to cheat for students who are currently taking the course */

This shows the cities that are being loaded into the adjacency list with their respective connecting cities and distances.

This is a demonstration of the program calculating the shortest path from one city to another with a certain stop in between being made.
